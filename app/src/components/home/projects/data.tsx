    "I built GEP to solve a frustrating problem I encountered regularly: searching through large codebases. Traditional tools like grep are great for exact pattern matching, but they fall short when you're trying to find code by concept or functionality, especially in unfamiliar codebases.",

    "What makes GEP different is its ability to understand code semantically. Instead of just matching text patterns, it uses vector embeddings to understand the meaning and purpose of code. This means you can search with natural language like 'how does the authentication system work?' and get relevant results even if those exact words don't appear in the code.",

    "The architecture combines several advanced technologies: code is processed and embedded using language models, stored in vector databases for efficient similarity search, and then retrieved and analyzed when needed. I implemented file monitoring to keep the index up-to-date as code changes, and integrated with Git to provide context around when and why code evolved.",

    "One of the most satisfying aspects was building the semantic search capability. By generating embeddings for code chunks and queries, the tool can find conceptually similar code regardless of specific syntax or naming conventions. The challenge was balancing embedding granularity - too small and you lose context, too large and you lose precision.",

    "The project taught me a lot about working with vector databases, prompt engineering for code analysis, and building maintainable CLI applications. I'm particularly proud of the modular architecture that allows for different embedding models, LLMs, and vector stores to be swapped out as technology evolves.",

I took a test-driven approach, writing tests for each feature before implementing it, which helped make sure everything worked correctly.",

I built a system that requests different pieces of a file from multiple peers at the same time, verifies each piece with SHA1 hashing to make sure it's correct, and puts them all together. Seeing that first complete download finish correctly was pretty exciting.",

    "So for this project, I worked with Skoda, VW, and Audi to help them track how their training programs were doing. They had all these training records - like over 200,000 of them - but no good way to see patterns or make decisions based on them. I basically built a system that could process all that data and show them what was actually happening with their workforce development.",
    "The cool thing was how it changed their workflow. Before, their managers would spend days trying to piece together Excel files to figure out if training was working. With this system, they could just open a dashboard and immediately see which trainers were effective, where employee retention was dropping, and compare performance across different brands. It cut analysis time from days to just minutes.",
    "Technically, I built it with Python and Django on the backend to handle all the data processing, with a React frontend for the visualizations. I added different access levels so executives see the big picture while team managers get more detailed views of their specific areas. It's one of those projects where you can clearly see the before and after difference it made in how they work.",

I also had to figure out service discovery so containers could find each other, and implement self-healing so if something crashed, the system would automatically restart it. It was complex but so satisfying when it all started working together.",

What started as a learning project actually ended up being useful - it's much simpler than full Kubernetes, so it works well for small-scale deployments where Kubernetes would be overkill.

I wanted to create a learning environment that not only tests your coding ability but actually teaches you the underlying concepts through interactive visuals and AI-powered guidance.",

The system analyzes your code in real-time, identifying potential optimizations and explaining complex concepts in an approachable way. It's designed to simulate having a patient mentor who helps you think through problems rather than just giving you answers.",

    "From a technical perspective, I learned a tremendous amount about full-stack development with modern technologies. The frontend uses React 19 with TypeScript for a responsive, type-safe user experience, while the backend leverages FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for high-performance API endpoints. The project also gave me valuable experience integrating AI capabilities through LangChain and handling complex state management across a feature-rich application.",

    "This project ultimately became much more than just a portfolio piece - it's a tool I personally use every day to continue improving my algorithmic thinking skills. The feedback from other developers has been incredibly rewarding, particularly from those who previously struggled with visualizing how algorithms transform data structures.",
