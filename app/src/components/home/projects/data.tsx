I built a system that requests different pieces of a file from multiple peers at the same time, verifies each piece with SHA1 hashing to make sure it's correct, and puts them all together. Seeing that first complete download finish correctly was pretty exciting.",
    "I wrote it in Go, which was perfect for this because of how it handles concurrent operations with goroutines. What started as a learning project actually ended up being quite fast - it can download files more quickly than some popular clients because of how it prioritizes which pieces to download first and which peers to connect to.

I basically built a system that could process all that data and show them what was actually happening with their workforce development.",

With this system, they could just open a dashboard and immediately see which trainers were effective, where employee retention was dropping, and compare performance across different brands. It cut analysis time from days to just minutes.",

    "This project started because I found myself making the same kinds of mistakes in my code over and over. I thought it would be helpful to have something that could automatically review code and point out potential issues or suggest improvements - kind of like having someone looking over your shoulder but without the awkwardness.",
    "What I ended up building was an AI assistant that analyzes code, finds potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. The interesting part is that it gets better over time as it sees more code patterns. It doesn't just look for simple syntax problems - it can identify architectural issues too, which is much harder to automate.",
    "I built it using Python with FastAPI for the backend and MongoDB for storing analysis results. There's a machine learning pipeline that processes the code through different specialized models depending on what kind of analysis we're doing. It's been really useful for my own projects, and a few of my friends have started using it too for their code reviews.",
